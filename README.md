 Wecome to my projects page. This is a summary of the machine learning projects I have explored recently.  
<h2>Breast cancer dataset - Classification</h2>

Full analysis: <a href="final.html" title="final.html">Breast cancer Wisconsin - Classification</a>

 <p>This project is based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin data, published by UCI Machine learning. It is implemented in Python. The diagnosis (Benign/Malignant) must be predicted from a series of cell measurements (concavity, dimensions, symmetry, ...)<br /></p>

<p> I started by exploring the data, both analytically and visually, before implementing a number of classification algorithms (Logistic regression, Tree classifier, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes). 
In a second iteration, I ensembled the 3 best performers with a majority vote classifier. <br />My final model was able to detect all the malignant cases in the sample (recall of 100%). It achieved a global accuracy score of 98%.</p>
